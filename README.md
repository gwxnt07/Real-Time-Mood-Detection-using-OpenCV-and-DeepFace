# Real-Time Mood Detection using OpenCV & DeepFace

**Final Project – Methods of Research**
**Submitted by: Keneth Campo, Gwyneth Esperat, Chester Sangcap**
**Section: CPE32S34**

This project is the culminating requirement for the **Methods of Research** course, showcasing the practical application of computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system performs **real-time facial emotion recognition** with integrated **video recording**. It captures webcam input using OpenCV, classifies emotions using DeepFace, overlays the detected emotions on the video stream, and records the entire session for review and analysis.

## Key Features

* **Live Webcam Feed** – Real-time facial detection using OpenCV.
* **DeepFace Emotion Analysis** – Leverages powerful pre-trained models to recognize expressions.
* **Emotion Label Overlay** – Clearly displays emotions over detected faces in the video stream.
* **Video Recording** – Automatically saves each session as a local video file for later analysis.
* **Fully Offline Processing** – All detection and classification is performed locally for security and privacy.
* **Six Emotions Recognized** – `Happy`, `Sad`, `Angry`, `Surprise`, `Fear`, `Neutral`.
